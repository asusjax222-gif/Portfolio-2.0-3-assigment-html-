Project Title
A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Problem Statement In this lab assignment, an external CSS stylesheet will be applied to the Lab 1 HTML file. Different sections such as <header> and <section> will be styled using element, class, and ID selectors. A consistent color theme will be created using HEX or RGB values, and typography will be customized with Google Fonts or the @font-face rule. The CSS box model, including padding, margin, and border, will be used to provide spacing between elements. The navigation bar will be styled with a background color and formatted <a> links. CSS positioning techniques—relative, absolute, static, and fixed—will be implemented for elements such as a back-to-top button or a sticky header. A <table> will be styled to display technical skills or tools, while buttons will be customized with border-radius, background color, and padding. Finally, visual separators will be added using <hr> and border styling to enhance the structure and readability of the webpage. Objective: Create a personal portfolio webpage using an external CSS stylesheet with a consistent color theme, custom fonts, and structured layouts. Include styled navigation, skill tables, buttons, and visual elements for a polished and professional look.

Detailed Instructions

Link External CSS
Create a new file style.css in your project folder. Link it inside <head> of index.html using <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">.

Color Theme & Fonts
Pick 2–3 colors (using HEX or RGB). Apply them consistently to background, text, and headings. Import a Google Font (e.g., Poppins or Roboto) in your CSS for a professional look.

Navigation Styling
Style the <nav> with a background color. Make <a> links padded, remove underline, and add hover effects.

Box Model (Spacing)
Apply margins and padding between sections (About, Projects, Contact). Add borders or shadows to separate content neatly.

Skills Table Styling
Style your <table> with borders, alternating row colors, and padding in cells to make it readable.

Buttons
Customize <button> with background-color, padding, border-radius, and hover effects for better UI.

Positioning
Try position: fixed; to create a “Back to Top” button or sticky navigation bar.

Visual Elements
Use <hr> with styled borders to separate sections visually. Add box shadows to images for a polished look.

Consistency & Clean Code
Keep fonts, spacing, and colors consistent across the webpage. Write clean CSS with comments (e.g., /* Navigation Styles */).

Expected Output

Guidelines to Students

Folder Setup
Create a project folder (e.g., portfolio-project) and keep files organized: index.html, style.css, and an images folder. File names must always be lowercase and without spaces. 2. Use External CSS All styling must be written in style.css only (not inline or internal). Link it correctly in the <head> of your HTML file. 3. Consistency Apply a proper color theme, use Google Fonts or custom fonts, and keep layout spacing uniform using padding, margin, and borders. 4. Professional Look Ensure navigation is styled, buttons have hover effects, sections are clearly separated, and the skills table looks neat. 5. Output Match Your final webpage must look and function similar to the given lab output/instructions. Test in a browser and make sure navigation, form, and table all work properly.

Improvements/Adjustments

Ensure proper color contrast between text and background for better readability.
Maintain consistent font usage across the webpage (Google Fonts recommended).
Check the layout on different screen sizes to verify it remains clear and structured.
Align the Skills Table neatly with bold headers, uniform text alignment, and proper spacing.
Use margins and padding effectively to center the table and form on the page.
Add hover effects on buttons for a polished interactive experience.
Use visual separators (background colors or <hr>) to clearly divide sections.
Ensure correct use of form structure with proper labels, placeholders, and validation attributes.
Insert at least one proper image (e.g., profile photo in About section) with correct size and alt text.
Write clean, indented code so the project is easy to read and modify.
